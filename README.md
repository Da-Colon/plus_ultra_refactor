# SoulReapers - React

## Decription

Original Description: This Project was our first Front-End Project. Our Goal was to create a website to allow users to look up information on thier favorite Animes and Games. This was a Project where we allow ourselves to play with alot of different things that CSS can do by aiming at a younger and diverse audiance with a very fun UI.

## Motivation

Originally DigitalCrafts front-end Project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The idea was to clean up the original design and make the pages more consitent with each other. I also wanted to maintain as much I could from the original idea.
